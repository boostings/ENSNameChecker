# ENSNameChecker
A private script used to scrape names from https://ens.domains/ 

This is basic script that uses Puppeteer to scrape https://ens.domains/ for available names. The names are pulled from words.json, which is a compilation of over 58,000 (http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt) 

The script also checks if a named is being auctioned, and sends a Discord Webhook whenver an auctioned name or an available name is found. 

This repository will probably be kept private and become a memory of one of my first coding projects. <3
