# ENSNameChecker
A script made for fun while learning JavaScript, used to scrape names from https://ens.domains/ 

This is basic script wich uses the Puppeteer library to scrape https://ens.domains/ for available names. The names are pulled from words.json, which is a compilation of over 58,000 words from the English language. (http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt) 

Additonally, the script checks if a named is being auctioned, and sends a Discord Webhook whenver an auctioned name or an available name is found alongside the price and auction date.

This repository will probably be kept private and become a memory of one of my first coding projects. <3
